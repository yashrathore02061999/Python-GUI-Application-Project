# Python GUI SOCIAL MEDIA Application

In python we have GUI applications i.e. graphical user interface applications i.e. applications containing frames,buttons,text boxes,labels
etc. and other components by which the user can interact with the application and store and process data in the application. 
The tkinter full form is toolkit interface.
The tkinter represents toolkit interface for GUI. 
tHE tkinter interface enables python programmers to use the classes of TK i.e. toolkit module of TCL i.e. Tool Command Language.
Tool Command Language is a programming language like C,C++ etc. but which contains predefined classes for GUI. In our python pgm
we make use of the tkinter module or the tkinter package to use the predefined classes of TCL i.e. tool command language to develop GUI applications in Python.Also TCL Language internally uses TK i.e. Toolkit language to generate graphics on screen.
